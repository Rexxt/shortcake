# Shortcake
Autounattend files for Windows 10/11.

~~**â„¹ Only 64-bit Intel/AMD systems are supported.**~~

Shortcake files aim to minimize Microsoft bloatware and system requirements, while enhancing user experience and shipping commonly used software out of the box, further reducing setup times.

Shortcake leaves user freedom where is due (region and language, disk partitioning...)

## Editions
Multiple different editions of Shortcake are available:
